# ArdyMed
ArdyMed is an effort to connect the Medtronic 630G Minimed with the iPhone using an Arduino to collect the data from the CGM and then send out the data via Bluetooth.  As the project unfolds, expect the Arduino Nano to be used and for the iPhone app to be fleshed out.  Features for work:

- [ ] Have Arduino retrieve CGM data.
- [ ] Parse data retrieved from the CGM.
- [x] Connect iPhone to Arduino.
- [ ] Relay CGM data to iPhone.
- [ ] Have CGM data appear on iPhone.
- [ ] Develop iPhone UI:
